main():
	1. Load welcome page
	2. Set up screen by changing its size to what's specified for the playing field
	3. Load player with atomic weight 4 and atomic number 2 with a blue color
	4. Set up array for enemy atoms (otherAtoms)
	5. Set player velocity in x and y directions to 0
	6. Display player data
	7. Watch for a WASD key press and set the velocities accordingly.
	8. Set the player's velocity to the new velocities from Step 7
	9. [Do emitter() on player] Check if the player is unstable and store the emitted particle from decay if yes
	10. If the player is not stable, place the emitted particle into the array for enemy atoms (see Step 4)
	11. Move the player by his current velocity (per frame)
	12. Do the groupVelocityUpdate() algorithm on all enemy atoms then execute Steps 9 - 11 for all of them
	13. Add 1 to frames
	14. If the player is defeated (atomic number = 0 and atomic weight = 0), play the game over sequence
	15. if the player has an atomic number greater than 118, play the victory sequence
	16. If the conditions in 14 and 15 are not true, return to Step 6

//Other important algorithms:

groupUpdateVelocity():
	//this is done on all atoms
	1. Generate a random number between 0 - 3
	2. Do Step 3 if the number from Step 1 is not 0
	3. Have the current atom do a random walk for this frame, skip Step 4
	4. Have the current atom locate the player and go toward him in either the x or y direction
	5. Go to the next atom and repeat

advancedCollisionCheck():
	//advanced here means a collision is checked for before it actually occurs
	1. Get the dimension of the atom (the smallest square all its particles can fit in)
	2. Check if there are particles (neutrons, protons, electrons, positrons) in front of the direction the atom is moving in
	3. If there is, track the top-left part of the atom (using getCollidedObjectFoundIn) and return this as 
		the coordinate of the object the atom collided with
